# 
# 1. Generate keystore using keytool:
#    keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/expensetracker-release.jks \
#      -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
#      -alias expensetracker
#
# 2. You will be prompted to enter:
#    - Keystore password (store this securely)
#    - Key password (store this securely)
#    - Your name, organization, city, state, country
#
# 3. Update the values below with your keystore information:

storePassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_HERE
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD_HERE
keyAlias=expensetracker
storeFile=/path/to/your/expensetracker-release.jks

# Security Notes:
# - Store keystore file in a secure location (NOT in project directory)

# - Never share keystore passwords
# - Add key.properties to .gitignore
